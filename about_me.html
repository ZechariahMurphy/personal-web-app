                        I began my professional career as a high school social studies teacher. The school where I worked operated with trimesters which meant I received a brand new roster three times a year. On the first day of each I’d have the quote above clearly projected on the board. I had a quote on the board everyday, something motivating or introspective, but I used this quote as my premier excerpt, for a number of reasons. First, I deeply admire Bob Ross. As a teacher I was inspired by his ability to entertain, educate, and motivate. Second, if there’s one thing I’ve learned myself, or that I wanted to convey to my students, it’s this quote. Belief that you can achieve your goals is the heartbeat of improvement, and I feel that notion is perfectly captured by those few words. Additionally, by teaching that mentality on a daily basis something peculiar began to happen, I began to believe it myself - which ultimately gave me the courage and confidence to leave teaching and pursue a career in software development. It’s still early in my developer career, but the belief that I will achieve my goals has only grown stronger with time. Thanks Bob.
