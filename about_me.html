                    I began my professional career as a history teacher. Every few months I’d get a brand new roster of
                    kids. On the first day of each trimester I’d have the above quote clearly projected on the board. I
                    had a quote on the board everyday, something motivating or introspective, but I’d use this quote on
                    the first day for a number of reasons. First, I deeply admire Bob Ross. As a teacher I was inspired
                    by his ability to entertain while educating. Also, one thing I’ve learned, and wanted to convey to
                    my students, is how true this quote is. I wanted it to be the first thing they saw as they walked
                    into my room and the first thing they thought about as they became my students. Believing you can
                    achieve your goals is important, but that’s only a part of it. You have to pursue your goals, put
                    plans into action, train and expand your knowledge in order to reach them. Everyday I told my
                    students they were important, their dreams mattered, and they could be anything they worked hard
                    enough to become. I taught that mentality everyday until I began to believe it myself, which
                    ultimately gave me the confidence to leave teaching and pursue a lifelong interest in technology.
                    Teaching had an enormous impact on my life, and I’m indebted to my students for their contribution,
                    but as a history teacher I was always focused on the past and my passion is the future. Software
                    development has been more fulfilling than I could have imagined. I’m willing to practice, and as I
                    pursue my interest my talent grows. Thanks Bob.
